# Start from zero tech experience

If you feel like you do not have any tech experience or exposure and are struggling to get into Cloud Computing, This Chapter is for you. If you are already experienced, Go to [Chapter 1: Infra as Configuration tools](InfraasConfigurationtools).

Let's get started.

If we start from the beginning or with the question `why`, we need to go for the configuration tool, Cloud Platforms. I think it would be an awesome start. :100:

The below videos should give you some understanding of the following :

1. [What is Cloud Computing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxT233EdY5c)
2. [What is Infrastructure as Code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POPP2WTJ8es)
   - [Again a deep dive to find meanings of infrastructure as code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxxRl6VEBxI)

## @ The end of this Chapter you should have the technical knowledge on

- By this point, you should be sure if you want to go forward with tech career and are prepared to learn new things, as it never ends. :+1:

## Certifications that you can go for

1. [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (002)](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate)
2. [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)

## What is Terraform?

It is a kind of a configuration tool, which helps you to build, change and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. It is an open source tool by HashiCorp.
It uses declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. Terraform, which is distributed as a binary, can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

> We will be using Terraform to build infrastructure mostly on AWS Cloud Platform.
