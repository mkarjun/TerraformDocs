# Infra as Configuration tools

We have seen the basics of Cloud Computing and Infrastructure as Code. Now we will see the tools that are used to build infrastructure as code.

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
2. [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
3. [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
4. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
5. [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
6. [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
7. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
8. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


> We will be talking about Terraform in this Chapter.

`So what is infra as config?`

> Wait, let's imagine a scenario :thinking:

```
You're about to start a firm and need 10 or more virtual machines, each with its own set of specifications.
What will you do? Go.  
```
Instead of clicking through AWS (or any cloud platform) and creating each one, what if I told you that you can just simply say to your machine what you need and in what specifications you want it?
Here, the language we use to talk to our machine is `HCL[HashiCorp Configuration Language]`

> Ain't that of a good explanation.

It is a way to manage infrastructure using code. It is a way to automate configuration, and managing infrastructure. It is a way to manage infrastructure in a consistent and predictable way. It is a way to manage infrastructure in a way that is repeatable, auditable, and versionable.
