## A simple starter Terraform guide for Dummies ðŸ˜Ž

> An open-source tool, to build infrastructure as configuration.

## Purpose of Document

This document is a simple guide to getting started with Terraform. It is not a complete guide, but it will help you get started with Terraform. The reason to create this document is to help people who are new to Terraform, such as me when I started.

At the end of it, you will have the technical knowledge for `Trainee` roles like
> Terraform Developer

> Terraform Administrator

## Can I really get into Terraform by being self-taught?

 Yes, `YOU COULD BECOME A TERRAFORM ASSOCIATE` in just within productive 30 days .
 And from here you can start, then go for the advanced level of Terraform.
<!-- and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).
See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details. -->
